            <h2>It started in 1995</h2>
            <p>
              Upon graduating from police academy in 1995, I started to work for Department of The Forensic Laboratories in TNP HQ for six years where I contributed different research opportunities about evidences such as cartridges, bullets, forged documents, handwriting and signatures and was responsible for the personal related matters of 30 police officers. Department of The Forensic Laboratories is the command center for all 10 forensic laboratories which are situated in different regions.

              I am certified as a police Instructor and forensic expert. In addition, I am a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE). I worked as an instructor at Police Academy and in-service trainings on forensic related courses. During my service presence in Ankara, I was both an instructor and a student.  I have considerable education to date including a Master degree; first I enrolled to the University of Ankara as a graduate student in the forensic science department in 1998, I was able to pass the lessons besides heavy working hours, and I had to cope with physical hardship and worked extra hours during my education. However, I did not finish my master thesis because of being redeployed to UN Mission in Bosnia Herzegovina. In 2003, after a series of selection process I enrolled the Institute of Public Administration for Turkey and the Middle East (TODAIE), which is an institute for governmental employees for directorial candidateship. I graduated in 2004 and earned BA degree in Public Administration.

            <h2>United Nations</h2>
            <p>
              I served for United Nations in different field missions on behalf of my country. The first one was in Bosnia-Herzegovina from September 2001 to November 2002. I had opportunity to share the information and experience with colleagues from different countries and backgrounds in an international environment. After assuming different task, I ended up in Human Right Office monitoring local police officers’ attitude to the different ethnicities other than their own while performing duties.<br> 
              Department of Peace Keeping Operations of the United Nations appointed me to UNMISET as a technical advisor to PNTL’s Forensic Unit (Directorate of Local Police) in my second mission. UNMISET Mission was established in East Timor, which was the youngest nation of that time. During this mission I received an invitation letter to work in UNHQ, NY for DSS, which is responsible for security related matters. Upon conclusion of the mission, I started in UNHQ, NY in May 2006.
